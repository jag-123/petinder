General Feedback:

- react-components folder could be cleaned up to be in sub-folders, especially because some of the files are specific to the routes information, and others are presentational react components, and it makes it very hard to navigate through each one
- good use of react-router
- register doesn't redirect to home page immediately after, and you need to refresh the page to get to the home page
- good use of petfinder and working through the API. I think you should look more closely at the https://github.com/mjhea0/passport-local-express4 example, and I had commented about it in Ariana's Twotter App, if you want to look at a correct implementation
- awesome visual layout and design of the app, especially the resizing of the image and the layout of the Pets-picking page
- work to have everything in es6 or es5 for readability


Homework Feedback:

Functionality:
- Completion: You have OAuth (except for a complete registration capability) and all of the features that you set out to do completed. (75/80)
- Bug Free: The app does seem bug free, except the registration part. Also, when you logout, I noticed that the route is not back at login, but instead at "/getPet?", which is not really accurate. Lastly, what out for the console errors and warnings that pop up, because there are quite a few. (18/20)
- Design/Usability: I really liked the styling effort. THe home page is a little sparce, and could have been removed or combined with something else. Also, the setting of preferences, tinder aspect and seeing all of the matches of the app was really nice! Nice work! Maybe renaming the navbar links would make navigation more clear, too. (18/20)

Quality:
- Good Coding Practices: Good use of ajax requests, and well-written components. (40/40)
- Readability: The comments on this app are extremely well-written, and functions and variables are named well. It would have been nice for the react-components folder to have been cleaned up. Also, there are some weird spacing issues that made your html for components hard to read. Lastly, remove unused commented-out code, and there is no consistency in ES6 or ES5. Linting will definitely help with making sure that spacing and coding practices are done correctly. (35/40)


Awesome job!
